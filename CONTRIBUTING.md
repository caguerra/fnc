# Contributing to *Fundamentals of Numerical Computation*

This project is making a transition from a traditional print textbook to an online-first resource. 

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the text and the code. That said, we are not looking to make wholesale changes such as adding or reordering significant amounts of material. The book has reached its current state over many years of development and use.

## Reporting errors

We welcome reports of errors in the text, math, or code. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/fncbook/fnc/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

## Suggesting improvements

If you have a suggestion for improving the text or code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fncbook/fnc/issues/new/) with the label "enhancement".

## Opening or adding to discussions

For Q&A and matters less specific than suggesting an improvement, visit the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/fncbook/discussions) page.

## Supporting financially

The authors have made a modest amount (less than 10K USD) from selling the textbook at the [SIAM Bookstore](https://epubs.siam.org/bookstore) since 2017. The book has always been a labor of love rather than a revenue stream, and we are happy to help reduce the cost of higher education in a small way. We also see it as providing an example of what online textbooks can be and do when freed from PDFs and proprietary platforms.

If you do find this resource useful, however, please consider [making a donation](https://buymeacoffee.com/tobydriscoll) anyway! Seeing that people are willing to spend even a small amount when they don't have to is a tremendous encouragement. We have decades of labs, projects, slides, and video recordings associated with this material that we could make available if interest is evident.

## TODO

- [ ] Handle Julia-specific references, exercises, and sections by wrapping them or giving all-language options.
- [ ] Add a "how to use this book" video.
- [ ] Remove numbers from equations in examples.
- [ ] Address the Algorithm/Function naming split.
